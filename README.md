# About the game
This was my kids first game and I gave them complete creative control just to see what they came up with.
I was very impressed with their creativity in art, music, and story.  My Daughter created all the art assets using
a Wacom draw tablet and my Son composed all the original music from sheet music using noteflight.com.

There was more that we wanted to add like the ability to move the character around with a walking animation
but we ran out of time.  We'll definitely be creating a post jam version.

This was also my first time using Phaser 3 and I really loved the experience compared to Phaser 2.

# Tools used
We tried to use as many open source tools as possible creating this game.  Here is a complete list of tools used.

- Phaser 3
- Firealpaca
- noteflight.com
- Gimp
- Audacity
- Google Chrome
- Webstorm
- Fedora Linux

# All original sound track
Here are links to all the sheet music that was composed by my son for the game.
