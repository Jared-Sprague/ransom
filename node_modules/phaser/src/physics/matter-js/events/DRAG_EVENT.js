/**
 * The Matter Physics Drag Event.
 * 
 * This event is dispatched by a Matter Physics World instance when a Pointer Constraint
 * is actively dragging a body. It is emitted each time the pointer moves.
 * 
 * Listen to it from a Scene using: `this.matter.world.on('drag', listener)`.
 *
 * @event Phaser.Physics.Matter.Events#DRAG
 * 
 * @param {MatterJS.Body} body - The Body that is being dragged. This is a Matter Body, not a Phaser Game Object.
 * @param {Phaser.Physics.Matter.PointerConstraint} constraint - The Pointer Constraint that is dragging the body.
